                            liquors – typically in bottles –
                            usually intended to be consumed off the store's premises. Depending on region and local
                            idiom, they may
                            also be called an off-licence (in the UK and Ireland), off-sale (in parts of Canada and the
                            US), bottle

                            store (in Canada, the US, Australia and New Zealand) or other similar terms. A very limited
                            number of
                            jurisdictions have an alcohol monopoly. In US states that are alcoholic beverage control

                            the term ABC store may be used.
